# OIBSIP_WebDev_Task2
I have completed my second task #task2 as part of my web development and designing internship at Oasis Infobyte.  

Task: Tribute Page

IDE: VS Code

Github: 

For this task, I chose to create a tribute page to Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the Catholic nun, and Saint.     

I chose simple concepts of HTML and CSS, trying to follow the semantic HTML.
